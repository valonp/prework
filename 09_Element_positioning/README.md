## Page header

In the page header there is a logo with class `.page-logo` and a menu with class `.menu`.
Make them arrange on both sides of the header - logo on the left, menu on the right. Both elements should also be centered vertically.

Get both of those things done using flexbox.


## Menu

At the top of the page there is a .header which contains a menu **.menu-list**.
Make the elements of this menu arrange next to each other. Use flexbox for this.


## Articles

There are articles at the bottom of the page.
Unfortunately, they are displayed incorrectly because the photo is displayed above the description.

Make the description in each article display next to the picture.
