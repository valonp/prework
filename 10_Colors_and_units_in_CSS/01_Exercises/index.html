    <h1>Prague</h1>
    <p>Prague is an administrative, industrial, commercial, academic, tourist and cultural center of international importance. It is the seat of the majority of Czech central offices (including parliament, president and government), religious associations operating in the Czech Republic, as well as numerous companies, associations, organizations and universities. It is the most important road and railroad transport hub in the country and has an international airport and metro network.</p>
    <p>Today's Prague was founded in 1784 from a combination of five previously independent but connected organisms, whose origins date back to the Middle Ages: the Old Town, the New Town, Josefov, Mala Strana and Hradčany - the seat of the Czech rulers. Since 1992 the historical town center has been on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Due to its abundance of attractions, it is one of the most visited cities in Europe.</p>


    <p>According to tradition, the original Czech name of the city of Praha comes from the Czech word práh - threshold and is associated with Princess Libuša[2]. The etymology of the name of the town built above the threshold or weir - a river ford comes from the historical name of the crossing of the Vltava River near today's Charles Bridge.</p>
    <p>According to the data of the Czech Statistical Office as of January 1, 2017, the city has a population of 1,280,508 people (1st place in the Czech Republic)[3], while the area is 496 km² (also 1st place in the Czech Republic). Prague is officially divided into ten districts, which in turn are divided into districts. The metropolitan area of Prague has, according to Eurostat data from 2004, 1,964,750 inhabitants.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The first inhabitants of the area on the Vltava River were Celtic tribes settling here from about 500 BC. They were gradually replaced between the 9th and 6th century BC by the incoming Germanic Marcoman people. First Slavic tribes came to this area around 500 years. The struggle for dominance led to the Přemyslid dynasty, which founded the town around 800. They erected two fortified settlements: Prague Castle and Visegrad. Since 973, Prague has been the seat of the first bishopric in the area, subordinate to the metropolis of Moguntsk. The city reached a special heyday under Charles IV. He founded the first university in Central Europe, the Carolinum, and after the founding of the New City in 1348, Prague became the largest city in Europe north of the Alps. In 1344, the Prague bishopric was raised to the rank of archbishopric in the church hierarchy. In 1419, the city experienced the famous defenestration of Catholics (the Hussite Wars), and in 1618, a similar event (throwing the Emperor's governors out the window) became the direct cause of the Thirty Years' War. As a result of the defeat of Czech Protestants on White Mountain in 1620, Prague as the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia and the entire Czech Crown lost its importance and remained in the shadow of Vienna for many years. During this period, the German-speaking community played a dominant role in the city (German: Prague); this did not begin to change until the 19th century, during the Czech national rebirth.</p>
    <p>In 1784, five previously independent but connected organisms were united into one town: Old Town, New Town, Josefov, Mala Strana and Hradčany. The reforms of Josef II also brought about the closure of half of the active churches and chapels and a reduction in the number of orders from 40 to 14[4].</p>
    <p>In 1848 an uprising took place (during the Spring of Nations). At the end of the 19th century many representative buildings were built; the city's significant position in the Habsburg monarchy was slowly regained. By that time Prague was already bilingual, and the Czechs and Germans functioned practically in parallel (dual - Czech and German - there were universities, theaters, etc.). At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, as part of the Prague asanacja, Josefov and Podskalí were completely reconstructed, destroying many valuable historical buildings.</p>
    <p>In 1918 Prague became the capital of newly established Czechoslovakia. In 1939-1945 it was the capital of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. As a result of the Prague Operation (1945), it was occupied by the Red Army. In 1968 it was the main arena of the Prague Spring. After the break-up of Czechoslovakia (1993), it became the capital of the Czech Republic. The current motto of Prague is Prague Caput Rei Publicae (earlier to 1927: Prague caput regni, and between 1927 and 1991 Prague mater urbium - Praha matka měst).</p>
