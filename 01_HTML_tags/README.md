## Comments

> In the directory with exercises you will find a file named `index.html`. Open it in a web browser (just click on it twice).  
> Also, open the files prepared for this exercise in a code editor of your choice (WebStorm, Visual Studio Code).

In the html file, there are paragraphs - each with a `data-id` attribute.
Your task is to comment paragraphs with `data-id` attribute set to **3**, **5** and **7**.
