> In the directory with the exercise you will find a file named `index.html`. Open it in a web browser (just click on it twice).  
> Also, open the files prepared for this exercise in a code editor of your choice (WebStorm, Visual Studio Code).

There are two lists on the sample page. Your task is to improve their appearance.


## Menu

Change the appearance of the `.menu` list:

1. Clear its styles. The list should have no padding, margins, or list item markers (bullets).
2. Place its elements next to each other. Use flexbox for this.

After completing the task, you can beautify the `.menu` by e.g. creating spaces between elements.


## Books

Change the appearance of the `.books` list:

1. Currently it has dots as list item markers (bullets).  
2. **Not changing the HTML**, change the list item markers to numbers.
