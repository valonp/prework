> Also, open the files prepared for this exercise in a code editor of your choice (WebStorm, Visual Studio Code).

Your goal is to improve the appearance of the page. Perform the task by adding styling to appropriate selectors in the **style.css** file.


## User cards

Beautify the cards with users.
Add the following to the element with **.user** class:
* shadow with parameters: x: `0`, y: `1px`, blur: `15px`, color: `rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`,
* rounding of corners: `3px`


## Avatar

Round the corners of the user image, to make a circle out of it.
Add the following to the **.user-avatar** element:
* rounding of corners: `50%`


## Links

The last thing to deal with are the bottom links. Make them look like buttons.

For this purpose, add the following to the element with **.user-btn** class:
* background color: **#4950F6**,
* text color: **#fff**,
* shadow: **0 2px 10px rgba(73,80,246, 0.4)**;
* remove the underline from the text,
* set the link to display as **inline-block**,
* add a distance from the edge of **20px 40px**,
* set roundness of corners to **40px**.
