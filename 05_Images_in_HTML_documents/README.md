## Images

> In the directory with the exercise you will find a file named `index.html`. Open it in a web browser (just click on it twice).  
> Also, open the files prepared for this exercise in a code editor of your choice (WebStorm, Visual Studio Code).

Insert all images from the `images` directory into the page code using appropriate paths (e.g. `images/photo1.jpg`).

Each image should have an appropriate `src` attribute and an `alt` attribute with text.
