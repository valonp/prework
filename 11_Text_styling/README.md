Our sample page does not look right. The client has asked to improve it.

## Container

Let's start by improving the appearance of the text.
Editing the `style.css` file, let's change the appearance of the text in the `.container` element as described below:

* fontface **serif**,
* text size **20px**,
* the size of the line spacing **2em**,
* text color **#555**.


## Titles

Now let's change the appearance of titles `<h1>`, `<h2>` as described below:

* font face **sans-serif**,
* text written in uppercase,
* letter size: **2.5em**,
* text color: **brown**,
* letter thickness: **normal**.

## Quotes

The last thing we will change will be the `<cite>` element:

* background color **#eee**,
* text in cursive,
* text color **#777**.
